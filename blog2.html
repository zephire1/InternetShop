          <p class="content__p">I found out about this salve from my grandmother who was looking for a remedy to help me with my furunculosis from which I was suffering for almost a year . She learned about this salve from her 70y.o surgeon who was taught this recipe in her student years in medical school.
              <br/>
            I have great stories with this product. One is when my grandmother got a pain on her heel. It got to the point where she couldn't wear a shoe walk because of the pain. So the only solution she saw was to make a Beeswax and Propolis Salve. That day, she applied it as a compress overnight. The next morning, she could not believe the fact that the pain was almost gone. That morning she had to get on the plane to fly from Ukraine to Canada so it was truly a saviour.</p>
